# 🧠 AI Models Portfolio – Chakravarthi Waghulabarana

Welcome to my AI project showcase! This repository contains hands-on machine learning and AI projects I’ve completed using Python, AWS, and various open-source tools.

I’m currently completing a Master’s in Data Science at RMIT University and passionate about real-world AI problem solving — from reinforcement learning to generative agents.

## 📌 Projects

### 🔹 [Q-Learning Route Optimization](https://github.com/chakravarthiw/AI-Models/blob/main/QLearning.py)
> **Course**: AI A-Z – Udemy  
> Trained a Q-learning agent to navigate between 12 city locations using reward-based pathfinding.

### 🔹 [Dynamic Reward Attribution](https://github.com/chakravarthiw/AI-Models/blob/main/QLearningImprovement-AutomateRewardAttribution.py)
> Modified the Q-learning logic to allow dynamic reward changes — simulating goal updates in real time.

### 🔹 [Intermediary Routing Logic](https://github.com/chakravarthiw/AI-Models/blob/main/QLearningImprovement-IntermediaryLocation.py)
> Added intermediary destination logic to Q-learning agents for more advanced routing simulations.

### 🔹 [Business Revenue AI Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk42ZYMgmk)
> Built an AI agent using Amazon Bedrock + Lambda to compute daily revenue based on user input in natural language.
